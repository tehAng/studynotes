### The Cold War

- How did the West try to contain Communism?
- Why was the Berlin-Blockade of 1948 significant in the US-USSR relationship?

#### The Long Telegram
- USSR justified its establishment of Eastern Europe as a sphere of influence due to hostile historical experiences of being invaded from the east
- Aggressive expansion by USSR to spread its influence and dominance
- Isolation is no longer an option: USA must be involved and adopt a global strategy to deal with Soviets
- War is not necessary - 'long-term, but patient and vigilant commitment' required

#### Adopting the containment policy
- 'With great power comes great responsibility'
- Lessons of WWI - isolation by USA led to European instability
- Did not want to repeat the mistakes
- Every Communist action will lead to an American reaction - ensure that USSR did not spread beyond the borders where it was already established
- Containment policy marked a clear shift away from Isolation policy

#### The Iron Curtain
- A term used by Winston Churchill to describe the separating of those communist lands of East Europe from the West, thus creating two spheres of influence

#### The Truman Doctrine
- Openly criticised and challenged Communism
- Urged the US to provide financial/military aid to any nations threatened by "armed minorities or by outside pressure"
- E.g. Greece/Turkey
- Domino Theory & Containment

#### The Marshall Plan
- The US provided economic aid for the reconstruction of war torn Europe, but why?
	1. Believed that economic recovery would stop the spread of communism
	2. A prosperous Europe would be a major market for the US
- 16 Western European states accepted the aid
	- $17b. USD over 4 years (before inflation)
	- Technical assistance, e.g. chemical engineering and steel industries
- Soviet Response:
	- Not acceptable
	- Boycotted the Paris conference
	- Accepting aid was equivalent to weakening control over Europe
	- Form of US dependence as it depended on the value of the USD
- Marshall Plan helped Western Europe to recover politically and economically
- Western Europe indebted to the US
- Made capitalism more attractive to Western European countries
- Undermined Soviet authority in Eastern Europe
- Soviet counter to containment:
	- Tightened control over Eastern Europe
	- Established Cominform (Communist Information Bureau)
- Setup Comecon to coordinate Cominform's economic policies
- However, could not match Marshall Plan in terms of economic aid

#### The Berlin Blockade
- Berlin was divided into 4 zones of occupation
- Stalin was angered by the actions of the West
- He decided to blockade the three western zone of Berlin
- All vital roads, railways and canals blocked, electricity included
- US Reaction:
	- Truman flew in supplies to the people for 11 months
	- To show how serious the US was about containment policy
- Soviet Reaction:
	- Lifted blockade on 12 May, 1949
- Result:
	- The hostility between the two blocs increased
	- Failure of the blockade humiliated USSR
	- Boosted US credibility and displayed their technological edge
	- Soviet act of aggression resolved French misgivings
	- Divided Germany into two
		- The three Western zones merged to form the German Federal Republic (West Germany)
		- The other zone became East Germany
	- Berlin blockade showed the West that they needed to stop Soviet aggression
	- Led to the formation of NATO
	- The Warsaw Pact (1955)
		- USSR signed a mutual defence treaty with her Eastern European satellites
		- Military complement to Cominform and Comecon
		- Was seen as an attempt by the USSR to strengthen hold over satellite states
