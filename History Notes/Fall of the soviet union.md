## Fall of the Soviet Union
### lesson 1
#### Key soviet leaders
- Joseph Stalin (1927-1953)
- Nikita Khrushchev (1953-64)

#### Key Western leaders
- Richard Nixon (1969-74)
  - Resigned after 5 years because of the Watergate scandal
- Jimmy Carter (1977-80)
  - Not good at negotiations
- Ronald Regan (1981-88)
- Margaret Thatcher (1979-90)

#### Structure of State
- **Failure of communism as an ideology?**
- Pure communism is achieved when state control is withered, i.e. no govt' required
- In reality, the Communist Govt' never thought their people were ready
- Created a bureaucracy to run the country, with a single leader in charge of the Politburo
- **The structure was heavily dependant on the leadership and system**
- Severe problems encountered in the 1980s due to poor leader health

#### Comparison of Economic systems
##### 1. Capitalist economy
  - Self-motivated system
##### 2. Communist economy
  - Government decides what is produced

#### General problems in USSR
  - No Quality control
    - Focus was on heavy industry
    - Consumer goods produced were often low quality
  - No incentive to work hard / alcoholism
    - No reward to work harder
    - Jobs were guaranteed for life; subsidised healthcare, housing and education
    - Alcohol was cheap and easily obtained
    - Many workers went home drunk
  - Excessive budget allocated for military
    - 50% of govt spending was on military
    - Investments not used to upgrade aging technology
- Under Khrushchev
  - Virgin Lands scheme: solve food shortages by growing wheat in central USSR
    - Involved huge manpower and costs but the climate and soil were unsuitable; Lacked transportation
    - Massive failure
  - Industries
    - Broke up central control and introduced a Council of National Economy to manage 100 districts - tried to improve efficiency
    - Rate of industrial growth dropped consistently
    - Problems blamed on Khrushchev
- Under Brezhnev
  - Politburo voted Khrushchev out of power over economic and political problems
  - Abandoned economic experiments; **Returned to Stalinist style of control economy**
  - Heavy emphasis on heavy industry again
  - However, economy continued to slide - required loans from the West (Détente)
- Under Andropov and Cherenkov
  - By 1980s, USA's GNP was 3X of USSR's
  - **Inflation, rising oil prices**
- **Worsened due to competition with USA**
  - Regan's Star Wars: USSR lacked tech and financial means to compete
  - The Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) focused on developing new technologies to detect and destroy any potential nuclear attack by ICBM
  - Pershing II missies placed in West Germany - aimed at western USSR
  - USA held 10 day military exercise with NATO without telling the USSR about it.
- Gorbachev's challenges
  - **"Global overstretch"**: Gave financial and military aid to left-wing regimes in Africa, spent millions on Red Army to support Warsaw pact allies and US$3B a year to Eastern European states (trough COMECON); fighting in Afghanistan still ongoing
- Social problems
  - Under Khrushchev
    - Tried to provide more freedom, consumer goods and invited a comparison of capitalism and communism
    - State system could not cope with the changes and upset many people
    - People increasingly disillusioned - destalinization backfired
  - Under Brezhnev
    - Reintroduces of fear via KGB
  - Basic needs of people were not met
    - Soviet citizens could not obtain consumer goods they wanted
    - Resorted back to black market
    - Bribed officials of obtain limited goods
  - Growing anti-Soviet feelings in republics and within communist bloc
    - USSR created out of 15 countries
    - Varying ethnic groups with unique language
    - Resented being ruled by the Communist Party
    - Control established using Soviet troops, which was another costly financial drain
    - e.g. Hungarian Revolution (1956)
    - Led to severe criticism from dissidents
    - Poor treatment of dissidents by communist govts was a persistent issue in CW relations
    - Dissidents were arrested, abused, sometimes executed/imprisoned
    - Many members in Politburo refused to introduce change
    - Ideas that were new/different were unacceptable
    - All challenges to their authority were met with force
    - Seldom picked leaders based on ability/talent
    - Chose leaders based on favouritism, friendship and length of party membership
- Political Problems
  - Soviet people could not choose leaders
  - Relations with the USA - (i) Détente
    - USA and USSR pursued right to exist side by side as sovereign states in late 1960s and early 1970s
    - Détente criticised by some
    - Jimmy Carter elected in 1976 to challenge USSR on human rights
    - Election of Reagan and Thatcher led to confrontational approached
