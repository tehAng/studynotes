Reasons for Gorbachev's Failure

1. Speed Of Reforms

	- Deeply entrenched problems which could not be solved with quick measures

	- Systems could not cope with all types of problems at one shot. Where to begin?

	- People found the reforms frightening, did not want reforms; some deliberately slowed down changes

	- Had to rely on themselves to achieve a profit or risk losing their jobs/factories (10% workforce drunk; 35 billion in rouble deficit)

	- No subsidies + High expectations -> high prices of goods

2. Size Of Problem

	- Huge country – difficult to implement changes across whole country

	- Problems ran from agriculture all the way to the officials in the administration. Managers were inefficient and corrupt.

	- Factories had never been energy-efficient; costly repairs/ improvements required

	-  No support system available for new products – warehouses, transport, shops to sell items

3. Lack of support from the West

	- Though Gorbachev was popular with the West, he did not receive much financial aid from them.

	- Gorbachev was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 1989

	- Moral support was not enough to drive reforms

4. Opposition from Communist Hardliners

	- Went against principals of communism with his economic reforms. Lost much support within the Central government by 1990

	- Glasnost and Perestroika - Reduce state intervention and power of bureaucracy

	- Endangered security of country and Warsaw Pact

	- 1991, group of hardliners attempted coup against him while he was on holiday in the Crimea

5. Opposition from Soviet People

	- Workers expected results and improved conditions before working harder

	- Pro-Gorby supporters were disappointed at his failure to meet promises

	- Short term problems – unemployment &amp; wage cuts: extremely unpopular

	- Gorbachev criticised heavily for Glasnost policy.

	- Failings of Communist government and atrocities of Stalin's era were exposed; further discredited the Communist regime

	- Democracy was new and people were not comfortable with the concept of freedom of choice

	- Glasnost turned people against Communism, not to support it

6. Multi-Ethnic Nature of Soviet Union

	- Glasnost and Perestroika led to rise of nationalism as Soviet Union was made up of 15 republics

	- The reforms then led to many voicing their unhappiness at being dominated by the Russians

	- The central authority and the Red Army were also too weak to control the whole empire from the capital, Moscow.
