#### Hitler's Expansionist Policy
- Step 1:
	- Germany's armed forces severely limited - Rearmed
	- Rhineland to be a demilitarised zone - Taken back
	- Germany forbidden to unite with Austria - Taken back
	- Sudetenland given to Czechoslovakia - Taken back
	- Polish Corridor given to Poland - Taken back
- Step 2:
	- After withdrawing from the Geneva Disarmament Conference, he began secret rearmament and conscription from 1933-34
	- When the Allies found out in 1935, France protested but was not willing to impose sanctions/ take further actions without British support. Hitler claimed self-defence
	- 1935 June - Britain signs the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, allowing Germany to build up to 1/3 of British fleet
- Step 3:
	- France and USSR signed Franco-Soviet Pact in response to German remilitarisation
	  - Hitler claimed that the Rhineland was under threat from the new alliance, hence he should be allowed to rearm
	  -  He took a gamble and sent 22,000 soldiers hoping that Britain or France would not respond
	  -  The League did nothing but condemn his actions as they were preoccupied with the Abyssinian Crisis
	  -  Made Hitler much more popular and bolder
- Step 4:
	- Hitler sent soldiers, equipment and aircraft to help in the 1937 Spanish Civil War - helped him test war-readiness
	- Union with Austria
	  -  Hitler encouraged Austrian Nazis to stir up trouble and push for union
	  -  Pressured Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg
	  -  99% votes
- Step 5:
	- Hitler wanted to take over Sudetenland
	  - Due to the Treaty of Versailles, the population of the Sudetenland was largely ethnic Germans
	  - Hitler instigated the Nazi Party in Sudetenland to stir up trouble
	  - When the Czech government suppressed the Germans, Hitler threatened invasion to protect German
	  - Czechoslovakia had a modern army and all its defensive forts were in Sudetenland
	  - Sudetenland also had important industrial resources
	  - Czech was willing to go to war
	  - Czech President was willing to go to war with Germany protected by Franco-Soviet Pact
	  - Neville Chamberlain went to Germany on his own accord to meet Hitler in Sept 1938
		+ First meeting: Agrees on a plebiscite (vote to decide which country to belong to); France and Czechoslovakia reluctant
		+ Second meeting: Hitler now wants ALL of Sudetenland and ALL Germans to return to Germany
	  -  Italy chairs the Munich Conference on 29 Sept 1938 inviting Britain, France and Germany to a meeting in order to avoid war
	  -  Sudetenland was conceded to Germany: Britain and Germany "desire" never to go to war
	  -  Chamberlain became a national hero (Peace with honour... peace in our time)
	  - Churchill called the Munich Agreement "a total, unmitigated defeat"
	  -  Czechoslovakia and USSR were not consulted: Britain informed Czech leaders if they did not accept the Agreement, they would face Germany alone
	  -  Edvard Benes resigned; German soldiers marched into Sudetenland on 1 October
	  - 16 March 1939, Germany invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia
	  -  Britain and France threatened to go to war with Germany if they invaded Poland
